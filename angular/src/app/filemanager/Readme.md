### Action Description

- **Smart Search**: This feature uses local embeddings to match search terms with relevant files. The search term is compared with stored data to show only relevant items based on semantic similarity, improving the accuracy and relevance of search results.
- **Content Summary**: This feature extracts and summarizes file content using AI. Users can access it via the "Quick Summary" button, which generates a concise overview of the file's content, making it easier to understand documents without opening them fully.
- **Intelligent Organization**: This feature categorizes and sorts files within selected folders based on AI analysis of file names and metadata. It organizes the files into logical groups, making it easier to manage and locate documents efficiently.
